**4. Code Collaboration:**
   - We will use Git as our version control system.
   - Our branching strategy will follow the Gitflow model, with feature branches branching off from the development branch and merged back via pull requests after code review.
   - Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
   - Code reviews will focus on ensuring code quality, adherence to coding standards, and catching any potential bugs or issues early in the development process.
